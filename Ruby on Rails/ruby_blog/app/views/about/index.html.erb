                    <p >Hi, I'm Cristian Santiago. I'm a Support Engineer  who loves to programming in Ruby and Python.
                        I created this Blog based on Ruby on Rails as a funny and super challenged exercise!!
                        Now I'm able to share my own Ruby content, get colaboration from other user's post
                        and improve new features on this application!!  </p>

                        Your suggestions are always welcome! </p>

                    <h4 class="text-center">More about me</h4>
                    <p>I'm from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and I hold a BE degree in Control and Automation Engineering from the <a href="https://estacio.br/" >Universidade Estácio de Sá</a>.
                    Currently I'm working as a Support Engineer at <a href="https://www.intelie.ai/" > Intelie by Viasat.</a></p>

                    <p>Recently I'm learing to develop using Ruby as the programming language and Ruby on Rails as framework, but I'm used to play with Python
                    for Data Science and Machine Learning.</p>
